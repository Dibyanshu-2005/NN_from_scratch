# NN_from_scratch
SOC Project on Neural Networks
So far 2 subprojects have been finished. In Projcet1, a small code has been writen down which comprises the construction of the feed-forward function. Project 2 is more comprehensive and involves a fully working back propagation function which helps reduce loss. There are sub files such as Activations, Layers etc. However, NN Final Project and NN Final Project(Retry) is the last submission which is in the form of a zip.

NN Final Project (Retry) is the final one.
