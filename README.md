# NN_from_scratch
SOC Project on Neural Networks
So far 2 subprojects have been finished. In Projcet1, a small code has been writen down which comprises the construction of the feed-forward function. Project 2 is more comprehensive and involves a fully working back propagation function which helps reduce loss.

NN Final Project (Retry is the final one)
